# Benchmarks (Placeholder)

This directory will host the benchmark harness, workloads, and baseline world assets.

Planned contents:
- `worlds/verbum-bench-seed/` baseline world data
- workload definitions and measurement protocol
- scripts or docs for reproducible runs

This file exists to satisfy references in `README.md` until the benchmark assets land.
