# .github/workflows/build.yml
# This GitHub Actions workflow defines the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline
# for the Verbum Minecraft project.

# It will typically include:
# - **Triggers:** When the workflow should run (e.g., on push to main, pull requests).
# - **Jobs:** A set of jobs to be executed (e.g., build, test, lint, run benchmarks).
# - **Steps:** Individual commands or actions within each job.

# This workflow is crucial for:
# - Ensuring the project builds successfully.
# - Running unit, integration, and performance tests.
# - Enforcing architectural rules (e.g., via custom Gradle build-logic plugins).
# - Maintaining code quality and consistency.

# Example structure:
# name: CI Build

# on:
#   push:
#     branches: [ main ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]

# jobs:
#   build:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#       - name: Set up JDK 17
#         uses: actions/setup-java@v4
#         with:
#           java-version: '17'
#           distribution: 'temurin'
#       - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
#         run: chmod +x gradlew
#       - name: Build with Gradle
#         run: ./gradlew build
#       # - name: Run Tests
