# TODO Index (Repo Agent)

This file is auto-generated by `tools/scripts/update_todo_index.sh`.
Do not edit by hand.

## Root TODO
- `TODO.md` (repo-level orchestration and wiring tasks)

## Capsule TODOs
- `modules/features/library/bible/docs/TODO.md`

## How to Maintain
- Repo agents run `tools/scripts/update_todo_index.sh` when a capsule is added or removed.
- Commit hook (if installed) updates this file automatically.
- Capsule agents never edit this file.
