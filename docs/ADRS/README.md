# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

// This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
// ADRs are short, textual documents that capture a single architectural decision,
// its context, the options considered, and the consequences of the chosen option.

// The purpose of ADRs is to:
// - Document significant technical decisions in a lightweight, accessible format.
// - Provide context for future development and maintenance.
// - Facilitate consistent decision-making across the team (human and AI).
// - Serve as a historical log of how the architecture evolved.

// ## How to use ADRs:
// 1.  When a significant architectural decision needs to be made, create a new ADR using the provided template.
// 2.  Discuss the decision with relevant stakeholders.
// 3.  Once a decision is reached, fill out the ADR, clearly stating the decision and its rationale.
// 4.  Commit the ADR to version control.

// ## Naming Convention:
// ADRs should be named with a sequential number and a short, descriptive title.
// Example: `0001-use-fabric-loom-for-gradle.md`

// ## Template:
// Use the `adr-template.md` file as a starting point for new ADRs.
