# Capsule TODO: <Feature Name>

This file tracks **capsule-local** work only. It is maintained by capsule agents.

## How to Use
- Add tasks you discover while implementing.
- Keep scope limited to this capsule.
- Mark items done with `[x]` and keep ordering stable.
- If you identify cross-module work (API/SPI/assemblies), log it in `docs/agent-logs/` and stop.

## Tasks
- [ ] <first task>
